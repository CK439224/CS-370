### **Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?**
  - For this project we worked with Q-learning algorithm. The project was a treasure hunt game that an AI agent had to find the most efficient path to the goal. We were provided starter code for the project and had to develop code for the Q-training 

### **Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:**
   - **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
       - Computer scientists look at a problem, disect it, and come up with solutions to the problem. When computer scientists do this for companies, they are looking for known solutions to a given problem and sometimes discover solutions to problems the company may not have even known they had. When software is developed correctly and with maintainable and adaptable code, it helps save companies money and time in the future when changes need to be made.
   - **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
       - In order to approach a problem as a computer scientist, I had to utilize critical thinking. I started out like most of my other projects by going over the requirements to make sure I understood the task at hand. I then made a list of what the final result needed to be and associated them each with a solution or two. I find coming up with multiple solutions may add some time, but it makes it easier when your initial solution does not work the way you intended it to.
   - **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
      - My ethical responsibilities to the end user and organization are similar to each other but also different. I have to keep the end user in mind when I am creating any programs I need to ensure that the end userâ€™s data is safe and secure and I need to have visibility as to what the data is being used for. When it comes to the organization, I need to make sure that they are adhering to current laws and regulations and if they are not, I need to ensure that I bring it to upper management and if no changes are made, I will need to blow the whistle on the company.
