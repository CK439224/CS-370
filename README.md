   - **What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
       - Computer scientists look at a problem, disect it, and come up with solutions to the problem. When computer scientists do this for companies, they are looking for known solutions to a given problem and sometimes discover solutions to problems the company may not have even known they had. When software is developed correctly and with maintainable and adaptable code, it helps save companies money and time in the future when changes need to be made.
   - **How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
       - In order to approach a problem as a computer scientist, I had to utilize critical thinking. I started out like most of my other projects by going over the requirements to make sure I understood the task at hand. I then made a list of what the final result needed to be and associated them each with a solution or two. I find coming up with multiple solutions may add some time, but it makes it easier when your initial solution does not work the way you intended it to.
   - **What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
